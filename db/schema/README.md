# Database schema history

This directory stores ordered SQL files that reflect schema changes applied in Supabase.
Files are immutable and ordered by numeric prefix.

RLS policies are stored separately in `db/policies/` with the same numbering convention.

Apply files in order in the Supabase SQL editor.
